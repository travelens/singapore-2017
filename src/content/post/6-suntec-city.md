In the morning we visited [Suntec City][1] where they had an exhibition of Forever Friends Christmas bears. We also visited Tokyu Hands and bought some pens and stationery there.

Suntec City is one of Singapore’s largest malls and shopping destination nestled in the heart of the bustling Marina Bay precinct.&nbsp;The mall is flanked by 2 Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) stations, the Esplanade and Promenade MRT stations.&nbsp;Suntec City is segmented into four zones, the North, East and West Wings, as well as the Fountain Court. It is also home to The Fountain of Wealth, an icon of Singapore that embodies vibrancy in bringing people together for the celebration of wealth and good health.

Suntec City is designed in the shape of an open hand, with the five towers representing fingers. It was built by a group of 11 business tycoons led by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing jointly invested in what was then Singapore’s biggest commercial development: Suntec City. Completed in 1997, the building’s design and architecture places heavy emphasis on _feng shui_ since Hong Kong people are known to be ardent believers in _feng shui_.
