We entered in the 37m high concrete statue of the [Merlion][1], which is a mythical creature with a lion’s head and a fish’s body – as a guardian of prosperity which personifies Singapore’s history as an important seaport. The lion head depicts the folklore of Prince Sang Nila Utama’s discovery of lion (singa) and City (pura) while the fish tail symbolises the fishing village of ‘Temasek’, also known as ‘sea-town’ in Javanese.&nbsp;

This is the tallest Merlion sculpture in Singapore.&nbsp;Completed in 1995, it was designed and sculpted by an Australian Artist, James Martin. I liked the view from the top as well as from the mouth.
