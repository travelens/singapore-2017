We took the MRT to [VivoCity][1] (HarbourFront station) to catch the [Sentosa Express][2] Monorail to [Resorts World][3]. This is a huge integrated resort spanning 49 hectares on Sentosa Island and features a number of attractions. Today we are focused on visiting Universal Studios Singapore. We bought the Ultimate Express tickets in addition to the normal ticket so that we can skip the queues.

We went on the following rides:

- [Madagascar &#8211; A Crate Adventure][4] &#8211; Join Alex, Marty, Melman and Gloria, the four heoes from DreamWorks Animation’s blockbuster movie Madagascar, as they embark on an unforgettable river ride adventure in Madagascar: A Crate Adventure.
- [Shrek 4-D Adventure][5] &#8211; Help Princess Fiona in a totally in-your-face fairy tale adventure. Through the miracle of OrgeVision you’ll see, hear, and actually FEEL the action from your seat! Join Princess Fiona, Shrek and Donkey on a honeymoon adventure that picks up where the Oscar-winning movie “Shrek” left off, through an original 3-D film, complete with jumps, bumps, bounces, air blasts and water spray that bring the action to life for each guest- with an extra dimension of special effects through the miracle of OgreVision glasses.

Hop onto the world’s first Puss in Boots’ Giant Journey roller coaster, and join Puss and Kitty on this anti-gravity, swashbuckling adventure atop a giant beanstalk in search of the precious golden eggs. But beware the legendary Great Terror who will stop at nothing to scramble the plans of those who come poaching.

- [Lights, Camera, Action!™ Hosted by Steven Spielberg][12] &#8211;&nbsp;Be blown away by incredible special effects as an empty soundstage becomes the setting for a Category 5 major hurricane about to hit New York City. As you stand in a boathouse by the harbor, watch how a clam suddenly turns stormy. Brace yourself as hurricane-force  
  winds sweep in from the sea and drive a cargo ship and debris towards the boathouse you’re in. Calm soon returns and the damaged boathouse restores itself, all thanks to movie magic.
