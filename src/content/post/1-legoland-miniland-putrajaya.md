Putrajaya is Malaysia’s third and latest Federal Territory located 25km south of Kuala Lumpur. Built on an expansive marshland and former oil palm estate in Selangor, the city spans an area of almost 5,000 hectares. Putrajaya takes over the administrative functions of the capital city Kuala Lumpur and is part of the Multimedia Super Corridor project of the Malaysian government.

The model covers the part of Putrajaya featuring Masjid Putra, Putra Square (which is actually circular), Wisma Putra and Bangunan Perdana Putra. I have visited Putra Square and can confirm the model is fairly authentic. There’s even a depiction of a marathon about to start from Putra Square.
