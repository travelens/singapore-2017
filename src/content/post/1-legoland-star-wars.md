Feel the Force all around you at this new indoor experience. Showcases over 2,000 well-known LEGO® Star Wars™ models and iconic scenes from all six episodes and the Star Wars™: The Clone Wars™ animated series. From a galaxy far, far away, all your favourite characters are now here such as Yoda, R2-D2, Darth Vader and the legendary Sith Lords, all made from LEGO® bricks.

The attraction features seven scenes from the six Star Wars™ films and The Clone Wars™ animated series. In total, the attraction features more than 2,000 LEGO® models built to a 1:20 scale using 1.5 million LEGO® bricks.

The display also features authentic Star Wars™ sounds, actions and lighting effects to create a realistic and enjoyable experience for the whole family. All the models were built in various countries, including Malaysia, Germany and the Czech Republic.

The exhibits take up seven rooms, each depicting scenes from each Star Wars movie, in chronological order. The first one you’ll walk into, based on Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace, with the majestic Naboo Royal Palace looming over the Battle of Naboo between the Naboo, Gungans and the battle droids’ of the Trade Federation.

Subsequent rooms will take you to Geonosis (from Episode II: Attack Of The Clones), Kashyyk and Mustafar (Episode III: Revenge Of The Sith), Tatooine (Episode IV: A New Hope), Hoth (Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back), Endor (Episode VI: Return Of The Jedi), and finally, Christophsis (from the Star Wars: The Clone Wars animated feature).
