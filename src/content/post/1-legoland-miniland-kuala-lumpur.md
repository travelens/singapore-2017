The capital city of Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur dazzles as one of the world’s most popular cities among tourists and fastest growing metropolitans in the country. Home to stunning modern architecture like the Petronas Twin Towers and British colonial-era landmarks such as the Kuala Lumpur Railway Station and Sultan Abdul Samad Building, KL also boasts natural forest reserves, scenic hills and pristine lakes.

This MINILand features Kuala Lumpur Tower, twin skyscaper Petronas Towers, Sultan Abdul Samad Building, Jamek Mosque (one of the oldest mosque in Kuala Lumpur), the Central Market, Chinatown buildings, Bukit Nanas Monorail, Sri Mahamariamman Temple, Sam Kow Tong Temple, Little India Buildings and Maybank Tower.
