Last day in Singapore! It was raining very heavily, so we decided to take the MRT and visit Orchard Road. We started at [ION Orchard][1], then visited the nearby [Wisma Atria][2] and [Ngee Ann City][3] before returning via [313@Somerset][4].

ION Orchard is fairly impressive, with an array of high end stores including all the luxury labels. We started from the top and visited the LEGO Store. There is even a Leica Store. There are various sculptures located on each floor. Some of the interesting stores we visited include Tiffany, Gucci, Fendi, the TWG Tea House, Prada, Moncler, Dolce & Gabbana. There were some Christmas displays outside and we managed to take some photos even though it was drizzling. For lunch, we ate Teochew fish balls at the food court.

We also visited the [Tangs department store][5] across the road. We used to visit the CK Tang department store in the 1980s whenever we visited Singapore, so we always made it a point to revisit the store whenever we are in Singapore.

Wisma Atria is somewhat less high end than ION Orchard but had quite a few stores, including a Pablo Japanese cheesecake shop in the basement.
