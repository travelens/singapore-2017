We walked from our hotel this morning to the Chinatown Station, and decided to catch the MRT to [Little India][1]. This was originally an enclave designated by the British for Indian immigrants, and the main thoroughfare is the famous Serangoon Road. The area is famous for temples/mosques/churches, historical areas and many many Indian restaurants. We enjoyed walking through the area and the colourful buildings.
