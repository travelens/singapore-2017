The final part of the Cloud Forest attraction is the Secret Garden, featuring an underwater pool with stalactites and stalagmites.

There are some 7,000 plants here of more than 135 species and hybrids set amidst a landscape inspired by limestone forests and caves. Apparently some the miniature orchids here are so tiny, youâ€™ll need a magnifying glass to spot them!
