We woke up early and decided to take a stroll from our hotel to [Marina Bay][1]. We walked towards The Promontory, where we say a group of women runners as part of a fun run event. Then we walked past [The Fullerton Bay Hotel][2], [Clifford Pier][3] towards [Merlion Park][4].

After taking the usual tourist photos of The Merlion, we walked across [Jubilee Bridge][5]. It started drizzling, so we took shelter at [Esplanade Theatres On The Bay][6]. We discovered by following people that there is an underground walkway all the way back to Raffles City and the City Hall MRT station where we took the MRT back to Raffles Place and then walked back to the hotel.
