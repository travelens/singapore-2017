In the Flower Dome, we wandered through the different continental gardens such as the Australian Garden, South African Garden, South American Garden, Mediterranean Garden and Californian Garden and finally the Olive Grove.

## Australian Garden

Travel through the deserts of Australia and see the native floral in full bloom at the Australian Garden.

In a fascinating showcase of plants Western and South Australia that thrive in a cool-dry climate, discover how different species have adapted to survive the long dry seasons, and how some plants have even come to rely on fires to aid their reproduction.

## South African Garden

Explore a sea of colourful flowers, evergreen shrubs, succulents and bulbs as you walk through the South African landscape.

South Africa is home to an amazing number of exclusive or endemic species, including ‘Fynbos’ plants. These species have needle-like leaves that form thickets of fire-prone, hard-leaf shrubs that grow in sandy, low-nutrient soil. Many of the plants found in this vegetation have small, dark leaves covered in a waxy outer layer that helps them to retain moisture.

## South American Garden

Wander through the stunning Chilean Garden and be mesmerised by exotic plants from Central Chile, such as the Monkey Puzzle Tree and the Puya from the dry rock outcrops in central Chile, and the stunning formation of large specimens of Chilean Wine Palm on the terrace.

## Californian Garden

Head up the stairs and be welcomed by the colourful ‘Chaparral’ from the Californian Mediterranean region. Comprising mostly shrubs and a few trees, these plants are affected by natural fires that occur from time to time. Some of the plants also display aromatic, downy foliage to discourage herbivores from browsing on them.

## Mediterranean Garden

The Mediterranean Basin is one of the first places in the world to practise agriculture, with crops such as olives, figs, grapes, wheat and lentils. This garden also showcases the region’s native plants, such as the Stone Pine or Date Palm. Don’t forget to stop by the waterfront and admire the beautiful row of Italian Cypresses, which is reminiscent of Lake Como in Italy.

## Olive Grove

Olives, figs, grapes, pomegranate and many other crops are characteristic of the Mediterranean region. Grown for thousands of years, they form an important part of the region’s identity and heritage. A photo in front of the magnificent 1000-year-old Olive Tree is a must before you leave the Olive Grove.
