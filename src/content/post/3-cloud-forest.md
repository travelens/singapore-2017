After lunch, we went back to the hotel for a freshen up, then took the 400 bus to [Gardens By The Bay][1]. When we last visited the gardens in 2012, I managed to get severe sunburns that lasted for 2 weeks, so we decided to skip the open garden and cool off at the [Cloud Forest][2] dome. This is essentially a fake mountain enclosed in a glass dome complete with waterfalls and treetop (and mountaintop) boardwalks. The whole dome is covered in fine mist and felt very humid and lush, but cool due to the climate conditioning.

We started by exploring the base which had sculptures and orchids.
