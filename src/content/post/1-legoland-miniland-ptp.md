Malaysia’s most advanced container terminal, the Port of Tanjung Pelepas (PTP), is located on the eastern mouth of the Pulai River in south-western Johor, Malaysia. Strategically sited at the confluence of the main east-west shipping lanes, PTP has a sheltered bay and no tide restrictions. Today, the port delivers reliable, efficient and advanced services to major shipping lines.

The Miniland version the Port of Tanjung Pelepas features the detailed LEGO® construction of the Port, from the massive ship harboured on the Pulai River to the miniatured containers lined up in the shipyards.
