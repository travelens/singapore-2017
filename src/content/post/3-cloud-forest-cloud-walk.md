The Cloud Walk provided fantastic views around the domeas we descend the mountain. We admired the vibrant epiphytes that clad the mountain’s sides as we enjoyed panoramic views of the Gardens and Marina Bay.

The Cavern features the characteristics of cloud forest habitats around the world, as well as and unusual species unique to them. Be wowed by the amazing adaptations of epiphytes - these plants don’t grow in soil, but rely on the support of other plants to thrive!

The view of the waterfall gives us a moment to appreciate Earth’s fresh water sources, learning how epiphyte-laden branches help cloud forests capture water droplets from mist and fog.
