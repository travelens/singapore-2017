Once a major Southeast Asian trading post in the 16th and 17th centuries, the seaside Hoi An town is basically a living museum featuring a unique mixture of East and West in the form of its old-town architecture. Now a UNESCO World Heritage Site, Hoi An is a popular tourist attraction with its historical buildings, picturesque beaches, retail hub and restaurants by the sea.
