Declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site and listed as the largest collection of preserved ancient wooden structures in the world, the Forbidden City is the most impressive Chinese imperial palace from the Ming to Qing dynasties.

Equally magnificent is the Great Wall of China, built as a barrier fortification in northern China. It’s also said to be the only human-built structure visible from space.
