Descending the Cloud Walk in the Cloud Forest, we passed through the middle of the mountain (Crystal Mountain) where there were many crystals on display.

We basked in the company of real stalactites and stalagmites at Crystal Mountain, and dived into a bit of geology! We learnt about how continents formed, the age of the Earth, as well as the importance of fossils in understanding our planet's past.
