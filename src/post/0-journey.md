We had breakfast at the Qantas Lounge before boarding QF81 at 11:15 to Singapore:

We arrived at Singapore around 5pm on Tuesday, checked into the beautiful [So Sofitel][1] located in the heart of the Financial District

We then headed out to the historic [Lau Pa Sat][2] food hawker centre (formerly a market) for a quick and early dinner.

I wasn't very hungry, so I ended up eating a small bowl of Teochew Fishball and Fishcake noodle soup:
