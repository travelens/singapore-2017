I would have liked to see models of some of the other places in Malaysia, such as Penang or Mt Kinabalu. However, we only get to see representations of the other states via their traditional village house architecture.

This features scenes depicting the day-to-day life of living in the villages of Malaysia.
It features 13 unique types of kampung houses from 13 states of Malaysia. It was constructed using more than 125,000 LEGO Bricks that take up 1,300 hours!
