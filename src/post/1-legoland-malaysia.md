In 2012, the 1st LEGOLAND in Asia and 1st International Park in Malaysia, LEGOLAND Malaysia, opened. It is the sixth LEGOLand park, taking visitors across Asia on a “brick-tastic” journey of LEGO adventures.

We visited the park via Singapore by taking a bus tour which departed from the Singapore Flyer. The journey took some time as traffic was quite heavy. We had to go through Immigration on both the Singapore side and Malaysia side of the Tuas Second Link (Malaysia-Singapore Second Link). After crossing the bridge, the bus made it’s way to the LEGOLAND Malaysia Resort. Although it was drizzling in the morning in Singapore, the weather at LEGOLAND was good but very hot. We mainly explored the MINI Land but also enjoyed the LEGO Star Wars exhibit. We also watched the LEGO City 4D movie. The theme park was very quiet as we went on an off peak weekday. On the way back, the bus was delayed over an hour. Someone being detained at Malaysian Immigration and someone else was detained at Singapore Immigration (shock).
