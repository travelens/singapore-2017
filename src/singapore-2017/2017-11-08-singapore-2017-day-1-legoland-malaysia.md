excerpt: "We visited the park via Singapore by taking a bus tour which departed from the Singapore Flyer. The journey took some time as traffic was quite heavy, and we had to go through Immigration on both the Singapore side and Malaysia side of the Tuas Second Link (Malaysia-Singapore Second Link). After crossing the bridge, the bus made it's way to the LEGOLAND Malaysia Resort. Although it was drizzling in the morning in Singapore, the weather at LEGOLAND was good but very hot. We mainly explored the MINI Land but also enjoyed the LEGO Star Wars exhibit and also the LEGO City 4D movie. The theme park was very quiet as we went on an off peak weekday. "
